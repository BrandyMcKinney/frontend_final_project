# Charity Organizing App (Frontend)

This is the frontend of my very first project that I built for my capstone project. It is a charity organizer called - GiveTo. The frontend was built using [HTML5](https://html5up.net/) as a template and built up from there. It wass deployed using Netlify. Please note I do continue to use this app as a learning tool on occasion so it may be possible that parts may not be fully functioning. In any case thank you for checking out my app, GiveTo!
